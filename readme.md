# Python Editor

### This is my Python editor written in... Python. Even though it uses just one external library (Pillow for icons), it has some functions like syntax highlighting for python code, an autosave function and a function to run the code with one click directly in the program.

## Starting with the program
1. Install python
2. Install the pillow library with ```pip install pillow``` (You can skip this if you don't need icons)
3. Run the program with python (python3 for python 3.x)

## Using the editor
In the main window, start writing your python code. The editor will mark keywords, variables, function and more.<br>
**Note: The editor does not mark errors in the code (yet).**

With the ```save as``` button you can save your file in a specific directory.
With the ```save``` you can save your changes. The ```enable autosave``` function saves your file every 10 seconds.
```open``` does exactly what it says... it opens a file from your computer.
The ```zoom``` function changes the font size.

The ```run``` function runs the program in a seperate window.
